or
```bash
git clone https://github.com/BreadBox64/RoscoTheRoswellRacerTwo.git

### 2. Install NPM / Node

Use [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm), [nvs](https://github.com/jasongin/nvs), or some other node version manager to install node version `v14.21.3` and npm `6.14.18`

### 3. Download NPM Dependencies

Navigate to the repo base directory and run `npm install` 

### 4. Run & Test

You should be able to run `npm start` to start a dev-server and then connect on localhost:8080

If using VSCode or derivatives, the launch.json has configs for both Firefox & Chrome debugging sessions, so F5 should open both the dev-server and a web browser instance
